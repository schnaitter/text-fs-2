    "text": "\n\n    Information from the Press and Information Office of the Federal State of Berlin:\n  \n\n    Berlin is sending a message of solidarity with Ukraine by lighting up the Brandenburg Gate in the colors of Ukraine’s national flag this Wednesday evening between 6:45 p.m. and midnight.\n  \n\nThe Governing Mayor of Berlin, Franziska Giffey, issued the following statement: “Berlin stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. By lighting up the Brandenburg Gate, we are sending a clear message, alongside other European cities, that we as a free city support a free and sovereign Ukraine. We are showing our solidarity with the people in Ukraine and with numerous Berliners of Ukrainian origin – as well as with the many Russians who are longing for peace in Russia and in Ukraine. They yearn for nothing more than for the escalation to end and for there to be a peaceful resolution to this dangerous conflict.”\n  \n\n    Berlin’s partner cities, too, are supporting the initiative. Paris, the capital of France, is lighting up its Hôtel de Ville this evening in a show of solidarity with Ukraine, and London is joining in with an activity tonight.\n  \n"
